*Creating a quiz application using JavaScript is an engaging way to practice web development while offering users an interactive learning experience. This project involves building a polished web app where users can answer a set of 10 questions and receive instant feedback after each response. The application should dynamically load questions, provide a scoring system, and offer a visually clean and responsive interface to enhance usability and engagement.*

*The core functionality of the quiz app centers around a collection of 10 multiple-choice questions stored in a JavaScript object or array. These questions can cover any topic, such as general knowledge, technology, science, or history. Each question includes a prompt, four answer choices, and the correct answer. When the user selects an answer, the app instantly checks whether it's correct and provides visual feedbackâ€”typically with green for correct and red for incorrect choices. This feedback system is essential to maintain engagement and help users learn from their mistakes in real time.*

*To build this application, HTML will provide the structure, including containers for questions, choices, and the score display. CSS is used to style the elements for a clean, modern look with features like hover effects, animations for transitions between questions, and responsive design for compatibility across devices. JavaScript is responsible for the logic, such as dynamically inserting questions and options into the HTML, handling user input, managing the score, and tracking question progression.*
